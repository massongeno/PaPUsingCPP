This directory contains all of the programs I have created whilst studying Bjarne Stroustrup's "Programming: Principles and Practice using C++"

This was created as a means to organize my work done whilst learning, thus the code is nowhere near perfect and should not be used to check answers.

Additionally this directory does not contain ALL the work I've done within the book, this directory only includes work I felt was important enough to keep track of.
