This directory contains all of the programs I have created whilst studying Bjarne Stroustrup's "Programming: Principles and Practice using C++." A majority of the programs
uploaded to this repository were created using the std_lib_facilities.h library included with the book, I have also uploaded the library to this repository for the sake of
keeping records.

This was created as a means to organize my work done whilst learning, thus the code is nowhere near perfect and should not be used to check answers.

Additionally this directory does not contain ALL the work I've done within the book, this directory only includes work I felt was important enough to keep track of.
